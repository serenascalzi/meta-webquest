# Meta WebQuest

## Notes
Meta WebQuest is designed to teach students about their preferred learning style and the strategies associated with that learning style. Through online assessments, research, and presentations, students develop personalized learning profiles that they can use throughout their college careers and beyond.  

This WebQuest is designed for incoming college freshmen, and it can be incorporated into first-semester curriculums. The content deals with metacognition, helping students to understand how they communicate and learn.  

Meta WebQuest can also be used to help instructors understand new students and the learning strategies that will work best with them. It addresses the fourth ISTE Standard for Coaches and the eighth InTASC Standard for Teachers.
